# BBB_Capstone_Expo

This project is similar to a "todo" list, but breaks each item inte list down to smaller tasks or goals the user might need to take. 
the goal for phase 1 was to have the ability to go three levels for each "trunk" item.
example:
 1. Education: {
   2a. math: {
      3a.  algebra:
      3b.  geometry:
      3c.  trig:
   2b. english:
   2c. social-studies:
   
Next with the "branches" I'll work to get the data to store corectly in the database (currently useing MongoDB)



Authentication for the login and signup process is underway (figureing out encryption for passwords). A good section of this step
is started with data from textinput are console logging on submit.
